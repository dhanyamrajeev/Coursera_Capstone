    "## Problem Description:-\n",
    "\n",
    "### This project tries to help  a contractor based in Toronto who regularly supply raw materials ( food ingredients and other related items) to 'hotels & restaurants'.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### The contractor usually source most of his supplies from local 'farmers & producers' and send it across to the 'hotels & restaurants' who are his customers. His main business objective is 'good quality raw materials and timely delivery'. To achieve this he needs to have a good warehouse on a right location which is close both to 'farmers & producers' and to his customers. A good warehouse at the right location can keep the items fresh and also can help to achieve speedy & timely delivery.  As his  suppliers (farmers & producers) and customers are mostly from the same area, the warehouses can be built on each clusters giving more thrust to customers and hence at each customer cluster.\n",

    "### 1- The project needs geo-locational information about the specific borough/town and the neighborhoods of the contractor's choice. For example, \"Scarborough\". We have the borough details with postal codes and the details of the neighbourhoods of the corresponding borough/town.  The borough details include its latitude and longitude information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2- The project also requires venues in the different neighbourhoods of that specific borough. Location data provider - 'Foursquare' can help in this regard. 'Foursquare' can provide us with the location information like latitude, longitude and distance from the center of the neighborhood to name a few. Other advanced information like venue category, popuarity, tips, price etc also can be provided by 'Foursquare'.\n",

We  have  collected  the above  said  details  from  the webpage  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M>. The details are then transferred to a dataframe.

We have to find desirable features of each venue. We decide category of the venue as the main feature. Then the venue's category is One-hot encoded. After One-hot encoding we are integrating all restaurant columns to one column \"Total Restaurants\" and all food joint columns to \"Total Joints\" column, leave the rest columns as it is. Further, we assume that all restaurants use mainly the same raw meterials. Hence the datset is ready for further analysis using a suitable machine learning algorithms."
